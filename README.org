* Emacs On Screen Display

I currently use Emacs as the engine that runs my window management
system. The specific module is [[https://github.com/ch11ng/exwm/][EXWM]]. Although EXWM is amazing, it is
beyond it's capabilities to manage Desktop Notifications. Being
historically a Gnome Desktop user, I really missed them.

This package teaches Emacs how to manage notifications received by
other applications via a D-Bus service [[http://www.galago-project.org/specs/notification/0.9/index.html][standardized by the Free
Desktop]] initiative.

** Features

   * [X] Central place to access all notifications received
   * [ ] Filter notifications by time, application, and status
   * [ ] Silence notifications based on custom patterns
   * [ ] Persistent cache for notifications (they'll survive Emacs
     restarts).
   * [ ] Optional integration with Emacs Mini-buffer
   * [ ] Optionally shows GTK+ balloons for messages

# ** How to install

#    It's available on [[https://melpa.org/][melpa]] follow the instructions to [[https://melpa.org/#/getting-started][enable it]] and
#    then run =M-x package-install<RET>eosd=.

** Requirements

   Emacs OSD was tested with Emacs 24.5.1 but will probably work with
   any version compiled with D-Bus.

** Basic Usage

   To launch =EOSD=, assuming it's properly installed, just execute
   =M-x eosd= and you'll be sent to the =EOSD Mode=. Use the following
   key bindings in that mode:


   | Key | Description                           |
   |-----+---------------------------------------|
   | =n= | Move to next notification             |
   | =p= | Move to previous notification         |
   | =g= | Reload notifications from cache       |
   | =f= | Prompt the user with the filter popup |
   | =i= | Toggle show/hide notification body    |
   | =d= | Delete notification                   |
   | =q= | Bury buffer                           |

** Modular Design

   Emacs OSD is organized in three modules: D-Bus interface,
   Notification Buffer, and UI.

   The *Notification Buffer* is the abstraction that binds the UI to
   the events received via D-Bus. It's also the place that filters are
   applied.
